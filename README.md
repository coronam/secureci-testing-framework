## Running Tests
### Parameters
The testing framework requires one parameter, and take three optional input parameters.
 * Test Suite
As the SecureCI Testing Framework is built on top of TestNG, it follows the testng testing suite example for determining which tests to execute. An XML file must exist following the guidelines outlined [here](http://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html#testng-xml). The path to this file must be provided, or no tests will be executed.  
 * Application URL
This is the default URL that all tests should run against. This value can be overridden in each test, class, or even suite (see below).
 * Browser
If unspecified the default browser of HTMLUnit will be used. Other supported browsers are Firefox, Chrome, InternetExplorer, Android, Ipad (only locally - not on grid), Iphone (only locally, not on grid), Opera, and Safari. To run most other browsers additional drivers may need to be added to the browser install directory. Multiple drivers can be found in the 'lib' directory.
 * Hub Address
If unspecified the tests will run in standalone mode. If a hub address is specified, then tests will run via Selenium Grid on the specified grid address. Just list the IP or DNS, not ports, or protocol should be provided.

### Eclipse
#### TestNG
Open up the Eclipse IDE. Expand the project in the left side navigational panel. Right-click on the Java file containing the tests (for our example it is SampleTests.java) and select the Run As menu item, and click on the TestNG Test sub-item. This will launch the tests.

Once the tests have completed running, TestNG results will be displayed under the TestNG tab at the lower section of the screen.

If you want to provide inputs to the tests being run, when right clicking on the Java file containing test, select the Run Configurations... sub-item. On the option screen, select the Arguments tab on the upper left of the screen. In the Program arguments input area, enter in the desired input details to be tested as below:
```
-Dtest-suite=smoke.xml -appURL=google.com -Dbrowser=Chrome -DhubAddress=localhost
```
#### Ant
Open up the Eclipse IDE. Expand the project in the left side navigational panel. Right-click on the build.xml file and select the Run As menu item, and click on the Ant-Build sub-item. This will launch the tests.

If you want to provide inputs to the tests being run, when right clicking on the build.xml file select the Ant Build... sub-item. On the option screen, select the Main tab on the upper left of the screen. In the Arguments input area, enter in the feature file to be tested as below:
```
-Dtest-suite=./suites/regression.xml -appURL=google.com -Dbrowser=InternetExplorer -DhubAddress=192.168.1.10
```

### Command Line
#### TestNG
Coming Soon
#### Ant
Open up the command prompt. Navigate to the folder where the Test Automation project is checked out using the cd command. Once at the folder, if these tests have been before, itâ€™s best to clean out the results folder. Run the command:
```
ant clean
```
Once that completes, run the following command to execute the tests:
```
ant -Dtest-suite=../acceptance.xml -appURL=google.com -Dbrowser=Firefox -DhubAddress=localhost
```
The default task is 'run,' which can alternatively be executed, or could be chained with other commands.
```
ant clean run -Dtest-suite=./suites/all.xml -appURL=google.com -Dbrowser=Android -DhubAddress=172.16.3.12
```
All test results will be stored in the target-output folder.

A replace task also exists to provide easy links in the test reports. This should be executed after the tests are completed.
```
ant clean run replace -k -Dtest-suite=./suites/non-destructive.xml -appURL=google.com -Dbrowser=IPhone
```
The -k option ensure this task is always run, even if some of the tests fail.
